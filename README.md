# Face-mask-detector

In this project we implemented a face mask detection system using computer vision and deep learning, specifically the MobileNet architecture. We also implemented an Attentance & Time system using the face-recognition Python library. \\
This was my first ever deep learning and computer vision project. Several tools were used throughout the project, basically Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV.
